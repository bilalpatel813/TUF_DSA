#Pattern 4

#Given an integer n. You need to recreate the pattern given below for any value of N. Let's say for N = 5, the pattern should look like as below:

#1
#22
#333
#4444
#55555

#Print the pattern in the function given to you.
#practice solution:
n=5
for i in range(1,n+1):
    for j in range(i):
        print(i, end="")
    print()
#TUF SOLUTION:
 class Solution:
    def pattern4(self, n):
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            for j in range(i):
                print(i, end="")
            print()
