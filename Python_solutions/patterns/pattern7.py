#Pattern 7

#Given an integer n. You need to recreate the pattern given below for any value of N. Let's say for N = 5, the pattern should look like as below:



#     *
#    ***
#   *****
#  *******
# *********
#Print the pattern in the function given to you.
#practice solution:
n=5
for i in range(1,n+1):
    for k in range(n-i):
        print(" ", end="")
    for j in range(2*i-1):
        print("*" , end="") 
    print()
